# Project1 - Dive Track

## Project Overview

Building a full-stack web application in collaboration with Adam, Darcy and Josh. The site will feature a dive log, different locations to scuba-dive and more. 

## Motivation (How & Why)

While there may be several comparable options available, none of them truly provide a user-friendly experience. Logging an entry or extracting the necessary information from these platforms often involves a convoluted and intricate process. Additionally, many reliable providers tend to charge for access, leaving passionate scuba divers no choice but to resort to manual entries using tools like spreadsheets.

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* Supabase
* CSS
* React

### Features

The application offers a streamlined experience where users can conveniently input information into a form, which will then store the data for that particular entry. These stored entries can be easily displayed or edited at any time.

Furthermore, the platform allows users to access and view all dive log entries in a centralized manner, ensuring comprehensive visibility and organization.

To enhance the exploration experience, the application also provides a search functionality. Users can search for dive sites based on specific locations, which will generate a corresponding map displaying the results. This feature enables users to effortlessly discover and navigate various dive sites of interest.

### Approach Taken

* Commenced by devising a website layout plan and crafting a mockup to illustrate the interaction between various models.
* Established a Git repository specifically for the project to facilitate collaboration and version control.
* Generated the initial structure of the React application by creating a skeletal document, and proceeded to import all the necessary components into the App.jsx file.
* Created the database using Supabase for the back-end.
* Expended efforts in determining the optimal approach to connect the database with the front-end.
* Dedicated time to seamlessly integrating multiple APIs into the application's functionality.
* Concluded the development phase by refining the website's appearance and applying stylistic enhancements.


### Difficulties encountered when building this

* The primary challenges we encountered centered around the utilization of Supabase as our back-end. Since it was a relatively new tool for our group, connecting it to React posed considerable difficulties. Moreover, the integration of various APIs proved to be demanding, requiring substantial effort to achieve a functional implementation.

* Another significant endeavor involved configuring the search query to execute from the navigation bar and displaying the API response on a separate page. 

* Implementing user functionality, including sign-up and sign-in features, proved to be a considerable challenge as well.

### How to use?

* Still a work-in-progress
