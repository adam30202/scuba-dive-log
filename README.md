# Project1 - Dive Track

## Project Overview

Building a full-stack web application in collaboration with Adam, Darcy and Josh. The site will feature a dive log, different locations to scuba-dive and more. 

## Motivation (How & Why)

Whilst there are many similar offerings to this one, none of them offer a simple enough user experience; it's often a highly complicated process to log an entry or to extract the information that one requires. Not to mention the fact that any good enough provider will often charge for access, so for the avid scuba-diver, they often have to resort to manual entries via spreadsheets for instance. 

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* Supabase
* CSS
* React

### Link to site

This is [a link to our git repo](https://github.com/darcyhmansfield/scuba-dive-log).

### Features

* You can input information into a form which will store the data regarding that single entry, which a user can then display or edit.  
* You can view all dive log entries. 
* You can also search for different dive sites based on a specific location which should render a map. 

### Approach Taken

* Started off by planning the layout of the website and drawing a mockup of the different models and how they would interoperate. 
* We setup a Git repository for the project. 
* Created the skeleton document for the React app and imported all of the components to the App.jsx file.
* Created the database using Supabase for the back-end.
* Figuring out how to link the database to the front-end. 
* Worked on integrating the different APIs.
* Styled the website towards the end.


### Difficulties encountered when building this

The main difficulties revolved around the use of Supabase as a back-end as it's a novelty for our group and connecting it to React was difficult. Additionally, the integration of the APIs was demanding and getting that working took a lot of effort. 


### How to use?

* Still a work-in-progress
